### Code Style

The project has its own code style, inspired by Java language standards and some of the best styles from [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Unit Tests

Is convenient to create UT's for new features or adapt existing ones for fixes. The [Google Test](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/googletest) framework was used for the unit tests and [LCov](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/lcov) for the code coverage reports.

### Code Documentation

For generating code documentation was used the [Doxygen](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/doxygen) and comments in its style.
