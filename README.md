A software simulator for the EPROM/Flash programmer via parallel port (LPT).

## About The Project

The goal of this project is to create a software simulation of both the functionalities of memory programmer boards via parallel port and the chips supported by them.

With this experimental code, for learning purposes only, the aim is to study the functionalities of these software and boards using the reverse engineering technique.

Supported programmers and chips are related to the following products:

- [EzoFlash+ Programmer](https://www.ezoflash.com/ezoflash.htm)
- [Willem Programmer](https://web.archive.org/web/20071104230522/http:/willem.org:80/)
- [PCB3B by Gitti Leo](https://web.archive.org/web/20081219032532/http://se-ed.net:80/mpu51/eprom/eprom.html)
- [Sivava Programmer](https://web.archive.org/web/20191110110101/http:/www.sivava.com/)

More information about reverse engineering these products can be found at this site:
